    <h1>Portfolio Questions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>
        <p>Prior to taking this class, I had the opportunity to participate in a coding bootcamp where I gained
          familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gained some experience in building basic applications using
          these technologies. Additionally, I engaged in various coding challenges on online platforms.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h2>
        <p>For my portfolio, I decided to use a Simple Website Template provided by the instructor. The template served
          as a starting point, providing a basic structure and design that I could customize to suit my needs. It
          allowed me to save time and focus more on showcasing my content and adding my personal touch to the website.

        <h2>What was the most challenging part of your portfolio?</h2>
        <p>The most challenging part of my portfolio was creating custom styles. It required additional self-education
          to experiment with different CSS properties and achieve a visually appealing design.</p>

      <li>
        <h2>How did taking this class change your view on Web Development?</h2>
        <p>Taking this class has drastically changed my view on web development. I went from having limited knowledge of
          creating and deploying websites to gaining a much better understanding of the entire process. From setting up
          a development environment to utilizing version control with GitHub and manipulating the DOM, I now have the
          skills and knowledge to confidently develop websites.</p>

        <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
        <p>To future students taking this class, I would highly recommend being prepared for an intensive course that
          requires hard work and dedication. Avoid procrastination and stay disciplined in your learning journey. It is
          crucial to follow all instructions and fully engage with all educational resources provided by the instructor.
