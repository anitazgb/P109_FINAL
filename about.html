            In my journey from Eastern Europe to the United States in 2012, I found my home in the vibrant Seattle area,
            where I spent 10 out of the past 11 years. One year was spent in the bustling Silicon Valley, California,
            where
            I had the opportunity to intern at a tech company in San Mateo. It was an exciting and eye-opening
            experience
            that fueled my passion for the tech industry.

            <p> For the past eight years, I've immersed myself in the world of quality assurance engineering, working on
                enterprise projects in well-established companies and diving into the wild and exhilarating startup
                environment. It's been a thrilling ride, filled with learning opportunities and the chance to contribute
                to
                cutting-edge software products.</p>

            <p> In early 2023, I made a bold decision to leave my job and pursue a full-time college education,
                embarking on
                a journey to obtain a degree in Software Development. It's a step I took to further deepen my knowledge
                and
                broaden my skill set in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

            <p>During this transitional period, I also embraced my entrepreneurial spirit and started a non-IT business.
                It's been an exciting venture, allowing me to explore different aspects of business management and
                challenge
                myself in new ways.</p>

            <p> When I'm not immersed in work or studies, I find joy in the simple pleasures of life. I love delving
                into
                non-fiction books, connecting with friends and relatives, expressing myself through playing musical
                instruments, and embracing the beauty of the great outdoors.</p>

            <p> Life is an adventure, and I'm thrilled to be on this ever-evolving journey of personal and professional
                growth, continuously pushing my boundaries and embracing new opportunities along the way.</p>
